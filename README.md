# os-s20

Developed a dummy OS from scratch with C programming to build units like **bootloader(part-1)** to load a kernel, **memory
management(part-2)** for a paged memory management system, trap handling for system calls and exceptions and **multiple
process management(part-3)** for a multitasking kernel.

Please checkout all 3 branches part1,part2 and part3 for a detailed view of the project.
